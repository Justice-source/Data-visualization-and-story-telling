<h2 id="including-plots">Including Plots</h2>
<p>Sure! To create an Data visualization in R Markdown using a provided
Pokemon CSV file, you can follow these steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Install Required Packages Install the necessary packages for
data manipulation and visualization. You can use the
<code>tidyverse</code> package for this:</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Step 2: Load the Required Packages Load the <code>tidyverse</code>
package to access its functions:</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>library(tidyverse)</code></pre>
<p>Step 3: Read the CSV File Read the CSV file into a data frame using
the <code>read_csv()</code> function:</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;pokemon.csv&quot;)


# Load data
filter &lt;- c(&quot;Grass&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, &quot;Water&quot;, &quot;Psychic&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Flying&quot;, &quot;Dark&quot;, &quot;Rock&quot;, 
            &quot;Steel&quot;, &quot;Ice&quot;, &quot;Poison&quot;, &quot;Bug&quot;, &quot;Electric&quot;, &quot;Ground&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot;, &quot;Fairy&quot;, &quot;Fighting&quot;)
df &lt;- read_csv(file.path(dirs$root, dirs$data, csvfile))

#show_col_types = FALSE</code></pre>
<h2 id="skimr">skimr</h2>
<p>skimr is designed to provide summary statistics about variables in
data frames, tibbles, data tables and vectors. It is opinionated in its
defaults, but easy to modify. In base R, the most similar functions are
summary() for vectors and data frames and fivenum() for numeric
vectors.</p>
<p>By design, the main focus of skimr is on data frames; it is intended
to fit well within a data pipeline and relies extensively on tidyverse
vocabulary, which focuses on data frames.</p>
<p>It is very good in summarizing a data set</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code># Type in your code after this line!
library(skimr)
skim(df)</code></pre>
<p>Step 4: Explore the Data Inspect the data to understand its structure
and variables using functions like <code>head()</code>,
<code>str()</code>, or <code>summary()</code>:</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>head(data)
str(data)
summary(data)</code></pre>
<p>I will make sure to customize the plots, labels, and titles according
to my dataset and analysis needs.</p>

<h2 id="data-pre-processing">Data Pre-processing</h2>
<p>Data pre-processing is an important and crucial step in the data
visualization and storytelling process. It refers to the cleaning,
transforming, and integrating of data in order to make it ready for
analysis. The goal of data pre-processing is to improve the quality of
the data and to make it more suitable for the specific data
visualization task.</p>
<p>I am going load the needed packages for this tasks in Rstudio and
proceed.</p>
<p>The original Pokemon data set included 1194 observations with 13
variables including Names, Type1, Type2, Hp, Total, Attack, Defense,
Speed,Sp. Atk and Sp. Def. [1]. The data set included a lot of
qualitative data that would not be necessary for this EDA(Exploratory
Data Analysis) so some of the variables will later be removed to enhance
better Data visualization.</p>

<p><code>{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'} knitr::include_graphics("image.jpg")</code></p>
<h2 id="data-visualisation">Data Visualisation</h2>
<p>Data Visualization</p>
<p>Now let’s look at our pokemon data using EDA (Exploratory Data
Analysis). This is a crucial step in data analysis because learning more
about the data before diving too deep into any topic might help you
discover information that changes how you want to proceed.</p>
<p>I will be working with Box plots, In descriptive statistics, a box
plot is a method for graphically demonstrating the locality, spread and
skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles.</p>
<h2 id="boxplot">Boxplot</h2>
<p>Box plots are a great way to look at one variable of a data set
because it gives you a quick way to see its mean, minimum, maximum, and
upper/lower quartiles. I created 9 box plots side by side to examine one
variable (attack or defense) across another variable (Speed).</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code># Generate Attack Box Plot
attack_box_plot &lt;- ggplot(aes(group=Speed,x= Speed, y=Attack, color=Speed),data=data) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x= &quot;Speed (1-9)&quot;, y=&quot;Attack&quot;, title = &quot;Attack Stats by Speed&quot;)

# Generate Defense Box Plot
defense_box_plot &lt;- ggplot(aes(group=Speed,x= Speed, y=Defense, color=Speed),data=data) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x= &quot;Speed (1-9)&quot;, y=&quot;Defense&quot;, title = &quot;Defense Stats by Speed&quot;)

# Arrange Box Plots Side-by-Side
ggarrange(attack_box_plot, defense_box_plot, ncol = 2)</code></pre>
<h2 id="section"></h2>
<p>It seems like the general mix of Pokemon in each speed column(attack
and defense) is relative. In the Box plot analyzing attack against
speed, Most Pokemons seem to have a higher attack level when utilizing
their attacks with increased speed. Whereas In the Box plot analyzing
defense against speed, Most Pokemons seem to have a higher defense level
when utilizing their defenses with reduced speed. Although defense
potential can differ depending on the pokemon and its type, most tend to
have a higher value for defense with speeds not greater than 100.</p>
<p>Next, I used box plots again to examine how Attack and Defense
variables changed across Type1(Primary) types.</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code># Box plot of Attack Stats by Primary Type
ggplot(data=pokemon_data_stats, mapping=aes( x=attack, color=type1))+geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()+labs(title=&quot;Boxplots of Attack Statistics by Primary Type1&quot;)

# Box plot of Defense Stats by Primary Type
ggplot(data=pokemon_data_stats, mapping=aes( x=defense, color=type1))+geom_boxplot()+coord_flip()+labs(title=&quot;Boxplots of Defense Statistics by Type1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>In our box plots showing Attack and Defense stats by Type1
statistics, we can see that Rock,bug and Steel types have the highest
defense usually while Electric and Normal have the lowest defenses.</p>
<p>Fire, Dragon and Ground types generally have the highest attack,
while Fairy and Psychic types have lower defenses. This may be because
Fairy and Psychic types usually have high Special Defense instead.</p>
<h2 id="scatter-plot">Scatter plot</h2>
<p>Scatter plots are the graphs that present the relationship between
two variables in a data-set. It represents data points on a
two-dimensional plane or on a Cartesian system. The independent variable
or attribute is plotted on the X-axis, while the dependent variable is
plotted on the Y-axis.</p>
<p>Next, a scatter plot matrix can show regression lines for how each of
the base stats relate to each other. This provides a more in depth p
view of the correlations between the data stats.</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code># Make a Scatter plot Matrix with Regression Lines for Data Stats
pairs(pokemon_data_stats[,5:11], panel=panel.smooth, col=&#39;light green&#39;,main=&quot;Scatterplot Matrix with Regression Lines for Data Stats&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>I don’t recommend the scatter plot matrix, once you know the focus of
your data analysis because it is hard to get any conclusive data
visualization when looking at so many variables simultaneously.</p>
<p>Our scatter plot matrix shows us that data stats for Pokemon
generally have a slight positive relationship with each other. This
suggests that Pokemon with a high data stat in one area usually has high
data stats in other areas. This kind of scatter plot matrix can be
useful for getting a very clear view of our data as a whole, but it
doesn’t offer clear evidence in our Pokemon data set.</p>
<p>Then, I created another dashboard with a series of scatter plots,
density graphs, and a correlation matrix showing the differences between
the Total stats and the other Pokemon numerical stats such as hp,
attack, defense, Special Atk, Special Def and speed.</p>
<p>Total stats of a pokemon seems to correlate alot with other pokemon
numerical stats as our results were TRUE.</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>pokemon_datanum_logical_Total &lt;- pokemon_datanum_stats
pokemon_datanum_logical_Total$Total &lt;- as.logical(pokemon_datanum_logical_Total$Total)
ggpairs(pokemon_datanum_logical_Total, columns = 2:8, ggplot2::aes(color=Total), title = &quot;Scatterplot, Density Graph, and Correlation Coefficient Matrix
        colored by Total Status&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The density graphs indicate that the Total stats of a Pokemon is more
as a combination of attack, Special Atk, and defense when observed. The
correlation coefficient matrix shows that most of the stats are highly
correlated with each other.</p>

<p>I think we can conclude that Pokemon did become stronger by attacks
based on higher speeds and some did become weak by attacks due to
reduced speeds. Now by defense based on higher speeds there were
variability but most of the pokemon did exhibit higher defense stats
with relation to speed and exhibited variable results with reduced
speeds.</p>
<h2
id="what-types-of-pokemon-generally-have-higher-attack-or-defense-stats">What
types of Pokemon generally have higher attack or defense stats?</h2>
<p>We can answer this question similarly, by grouping our dataset by
Type1 and calculating the mean Attack and Defense stats of each
type.</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>  data %&gt;%
  group_by(Type1) %&gt;%
  summarise_at(c(&quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Defense&quot;), mean, na.rm = TRUE) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(Attack)) %&gt;% 
  
  </code></pre>
<p>Fighting types exhibiting the higher attack and defense stats
according to our data visualization. We can see that Fighting, Dragon
and Ground generally have the highest Attack and Defense stats, while
Bug, Ghost, and Fairy types have the lowest.</p>
<h2
id="what-types-of-pokemon-generally-have-sp.-atk-or-sp.-def-stats">What
types of Pokemon generally have SP. Atk or SP. Def stats?</h2>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that there are also Special Attack and
Special Defense types however, and these stats are particularly high in
Psychic and Dragon types which explains discrepancy in data
visualisation with attack and defense stats when cross analysed with
special attack and special defense stats.</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>data %&gt;%
  group_by(Type1) %&gt;%
  summarise_at(c(&quot;Sp. Atk&quot;, &quot;Sp. Def&quot;), mean, na.rm = TRUE) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(`Sp. Atk`)) %&gt;% 
  </code></pre>
<p>Pokemon types with special attack and defense abilities goes to
psychic types. Psychic, Dragon and Electric types are the highest in
terms of special attacks and defense stats. Where as Pokemon with the
lowest stats for special attack and special defense were Fighting, Bug
and Ground.</p>
<h2
id="does-speed-have-any-correlation-with-hp-attack-or-defense-stats">Does
Speed have any correlation with hp, attack, or defense stats?</h2>
<p>We can check this by constructing a correlation matrix that shows how
much Speed is correlated with HP, Attack, and Defense in the
dataset.</p>
<pre class="{r}"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
 
# compute the correlation of each feature with Speed
cor_df &lt;- pokemon_datanum_stats
  pokemon_datanum_stats %&gt;%    select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;%
  cor() %&gt;%
  as.data.frame() %&gt;%
  select(speed_Corr = speed) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(abs(speed_Corr))) %&gt;%
  rownames_to_column(var = &quot;variable&quot;)
cor_df</code></pre>
<p>We can see that while speed does have some correlation with Total. I
believe that 0.7 as a good threshold for what is a strong enough
correlation to be significant and legitimate to consider correlation.
Then according to the visualized data, I would not say that speed is
really correlated with any numeric variables in the Pokemon data set
except special attack attack and total.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This AngelHack Monthly Code Challenge was interesting to me and was a
great opportunity to apply my coding skill on R as well as
EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) techniques to Pokemon data. I am
currently a student in a computer Engineering and working towards
getting a Data Analyst certification.</p>
<p>I used EDA and correlation matrix, scatter plots and box plots
techniques in this project, in addition to packages like yardstick,
ggplot2,ggpubr ,tidyverse, L1pack, DT, dplyr and GGally used for data
visualizations.</p>
<p>To an avid Pokemon player, these visualizations could be used when
building a team to see which types of Pokemon have what attack and
defense profile, or deciding which game to play if you want generally
stronger or weaker Pokemon. I hope this data visualization were helpful
in helping you better understand the patterns and trends within the data
in R. My primary goal of this was to present the pokemon data sets in an
easily understandable and visually appealing way.</p>
